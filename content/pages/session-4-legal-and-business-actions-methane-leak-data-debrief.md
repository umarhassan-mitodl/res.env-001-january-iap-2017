Summary
-------

Objectives: Discuss two examples of how data can inform public decision-making: using citizen-collected data in legal cases, and developing a more accurate and consistent measure of the carbon footprints of goods and services. Debrief of methane leak data collected on the prior field trip session.

Session structure: Two-hour classroom session, consisting of several lecture segments with Q&A and an open moderated discussion with all participants at the end.

Part 1: Environmental Legal Action, Scientific Evidence and Citizen Data
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Instructor: Chris Nidel, Esq. ([environmental attorney](http://www.nidellaw.com/), [MITACAL](http://www.mitacal.org/))

Learn about how citizen-collected data can be used in environmental legal cases. For instance, how do courts decide whether particular data is admissable as evidence?
