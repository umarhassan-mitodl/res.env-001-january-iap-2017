Course Overview
---------------

Put citizen science into action to tackle climate change! This course explores approaches to applying scientific data and new technologies toward climate-related research needs, community risks, and policy actions. Natural gas leaks (a major source of methane emissions) will be a particular focus. Through in-class lectures and discussion, a "maker"-style activity and a data collection field trip, participants will learn about effective science-based community action and practice putting that knowledge into action themselves.

Prerequisites
-------------

This non-credit course has no prerequisites. Problem solvers of all backgrounds and experience levels are welcome. Just bring a passion for changing the world for the better and an eagerness to roll up your sleeves.
